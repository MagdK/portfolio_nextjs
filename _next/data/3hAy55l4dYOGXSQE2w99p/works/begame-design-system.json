Built on Bootstrap, this system not only enhanced consistency in design but also allowed for faster implementation of features and smoother communication between teams. It became the backbone of our UI development, providing reusable components and design guidelines that scaled efficiently as the product evolved.</p>\n<h2>Problem</h2>\n<p>Bingocams.co.uk gets a UI refresh. Not relying on a consistent and well structured component library makes the design and implementation process hard and gives an inconsistent experience to the users.</p>\n<h2>Objectives</h2>\n<p>Find a library that can be used with Vue to speed up the redesig and development process.</p>\n<h2>Goal</h2>\n<p>How might we create a user interface that gives the users a consistent and clear experience?</p>\n<h2>Needs</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Accessibile.</li>\n<li>Scalable.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Wants</h2>\n<p>Plug and play components instead of custom components whenever possible.</p>\n<p>At Begame I helped develop a design system that significantly sped up the design process and made the Bingocams platform more consistent. In collaboration with the lead UXer, Karen Namgung we were responsible for leading the design in this project and researching how to best build such a system, made sure that our library is accessible, future-focused and human-centred. The result is that there is now a solid framework which can be further improved as the platform matures.</p>\n","images":["/works/begame-design-system/begame-design-system@2x.png","/works/begame-design-system/Design system_2.png","/works/begame-design-system/Design system_3.png","/works/begame-design-system/Design system_4.png"],"videos":[]},"__N_SSG":true}

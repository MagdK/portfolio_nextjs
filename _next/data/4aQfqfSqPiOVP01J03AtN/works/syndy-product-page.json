He created the wireframe and gave me the copy to work with. I created\nicons to illustrate what is Syndy used for.</p>\n<p>Also made a nice looking 4 steps guide to show how the export works, and created\nsreenshots to let the visitors have a closer look of what else Syndy can offer\nto them. The final result turned out to be a nice summary of the platform,\nsimple, clean and easy to understand for those also who are not in this\nbusiness.</p>\n","images":["/works/syndy-product-page/product_page_1800_01.png","/works/syndy-product-page/product_page_1800_02.png","/works/syndy-product-page/product_page_1800_03_gif.gif","/works/syndy-product-page/product_page_1800_03.png"],"videos":[]},"__N_SSG":true}

I was\nworking together with the company’s CTO <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://nl.linkedin.com/in/rogier-pennink-05684b41\"><em>Rogier Pennink</em></a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://khalidl.nl\"><em>Khalid\nLaouhi</em></a>, lead designer at Syndy. The main email types were the\nfollowing: welcome emails, invite emails and platform related notifications. The\ncolour choices are based on the platform guides created by Khalid. It was\nimportant to keep the main elements consistent in every case. For a better\nunderstanding I made a short guideline for the developers. The final results are\nclear and minimalistic.</p>\n","images":["/works/syndy-email-templates/email_1800_04.png","/works/syndy-email-templates/email_1800_03.png","/works/syndy-email-templates/email_1800_02.png","/works/syndy-email-templates/email_1800_01.png"],"videos":[]},"__N_SSG":true}

With a date picker you can select any other day in the past and make a new API call that will update the page accordingly. With the help of next and previous buttons you are able to go one day forward or backward. The random button will pick you a date between June 16 1995 (since this API is running) and today.</p>\n<p>Check out the app on Heroku to see the end result (heads-up: it might take a bit of time to load) or go to the Github repository.</p>\n","images":[],"videos":[]},"__N_SSG":true}

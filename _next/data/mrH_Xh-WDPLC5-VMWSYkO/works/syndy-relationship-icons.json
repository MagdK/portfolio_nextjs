I had the chance to take a peek into user experience\ndesign working together with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://nl.linkedin.com/in/rogier-pennink-05684b41\"><em>Rogier Pennink</em></a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://khalidl.nl\"><em>Khalid\nLaouhi</em></a>.</p>\n<p>My task was to create icons to give visual guidance for the users. There were\nfour cases: multi-pack, variety-pack, outer package and variant. First I needed\nto figure out what object should be used. I made some sketches, played around\nwith different kind of shapes and objects. A bottle seamed to be the best\nrecognisable object to go with.  The next step was to finalise the visual. I\nalso experimented with colours, at the end I create something easy to grasp so\nthe user can rely on it.</p>\n<p>Khalid created sprites out of them on codepen.io so the development team was\nable to implement it more easily.</p>\n","images":["/works/syndy-relationship-icons/relationship_1800_01.png","/works/syndy-relationship-icons/relationship_1800_02.png","/works/syndy-relationship-icons/relationship_1800_03.png","/works/syndy-relationship-icons/relationship_1800_04.png","/works/syndy-relationship-icons/relationship_1800_05.png","/works/syndy-relationship-icons/relationship_1800_06.gif"],"videos":[]},"__N_SSG":true}

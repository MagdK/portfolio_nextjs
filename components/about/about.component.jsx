            <p>
            Prior to frontend development, I’ve worked in startups, nonprofits, and creative agencies.
            </p>
            <p>
            Everything I’ve done has been in pursuit of understanding people more deeply, solving problems and fostering moments of empathy.
            </p>
            <p>
            As a designer, I’m interested in how to create experiences that are impactful, intuitive, and perhaps, even a bit delightful.
            </p>
            <p>
            As a human, I’m frequently spotted drinking tea, staring at birds, and talking about my cats.
            </p>
          </div>

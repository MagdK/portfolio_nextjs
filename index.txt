## Tools
UserTesting.com, Whimsical, Sketch, Zeplin, BootstrapVue, Material Icons, Jira

## Duration
3 X 2 week sprints

## Project overview
To improve the user experience for an online gaming app, this project aimed to streamline deposit and withdrawal processes. The primary goals were to reduce overspending, lower user churn, and enhance user satisfaction with transaction clarity and accessibility.

## Research
To gather insights, I conducted user research through unmoderated tests on UserTesting.com and interviewed five new users and five long-term users to identify specific pain points and expectations around transaction processes.

## Key findings
While users reported that depositing and withdrawing funds were straightforward, they often felt uncertain about the transaction duration and processing times. This lack of clarity led to frequent support inquiries, creating frustration and increasing support workload.

## Problem statement
Bingocams’ community members experienced challenges in obtaining a clear, organized overview of their transactions. Although the transaction processes themselves were functional, a lack of clear information led to user confusion, increased customer support inquiries, and, potentially, member attrition.

## Solution
To address these challenges, I proposed a redesign of the transactions page. The updated design was intended to provide a more organized, accessible, and informative transaction experience that empowered users to track their activity confidently and independently.

- Wireframes: I created low-fidelity wireframes to outline key layout changes, ensuring the design prioritized clarity and usability.

- High-fidelity designs: Once approved, I developed high-fidelity prototypes that visually emphasized transaction status, estimated processing times, and clear labels for each transaction type.

- Testing: I conducted usability tests with five users on UserTesting.com to validate and refine the high-fidelity prototypes.

- Design system integration: To ensure consistency, I created components for the design system and detailed guidelines to support development and QA teams.

## Impact
The redesigned transactions page resulted in substantial improvements across key areas:

- <mark>Reduced support inquiries</mark>: With a clearer layout and transaction duration information, users were able to find answers independently, reducing the burden on customer support.

- Increased user satisfaction: The improved interface boosted user confidence, leading to more positive feedback and a more satisfying app experience.

- Lower user churn: By improving clarity and reducing friction, the updated transactions page supported user retention and engagement.

- Enhanced engagement: With a streamlined, accessible transaction page, users felt more comfortable engaging with the app, likely contributing to increased participation in games and events.

- Data-driven insights: The feedback collected throughout the testing and launch phases provided valuable insights for future iterations and enhancements.

## Reflection
This project highlighted the power of research and iterative design in resolving user pain points. By actively involving users in the testing process, we were able to make informed design choices that directly addressed their needs and expectations, enhancing both the user experience and the operational efficiency of the platform.

However, the lack of a structured component library created inefficiencies in the design and development process, often resulting in an inconsistent user experience and requiring repetitive work for common UI elements. This inconsistency affected both the platform’s usability and the speed of implementation.

## Process
- Research & Analysis: Conducted an audit of existing UI elements to identify inconsistencies and redundancies across the platform.

- Design System Structure: Created a component library using BootstrapVue as a foundation, prioritizing components commonly used across Bingocams.co.uk. Worked with stakeholders to define design guidelines, ensuring they were aligned with the brand’s visual identity and adaptable to various platform requirements.

- Documentation: Documented each component’s usage, interaction states, and styling specifications in Zeplin, making it easier for developers to integrate components accurately.

- Iterative Testing & Feedback: Regularly tested components in the platform environment, gathered feedback from both designers and developers, and made adjustments as needed. This collaborative process helped us refine and expand the design system over time.

## Impact
The introduction of the design system had a notable impact on both the product and team workflows:

- Consistency and Cohesion: The platform's visual consistency improved significantly, providing users with a seamless and intuitive interface that aligned with Bingocams’ brand identity.

- Efficiency and Productivity: With a shared library of components and design guidelines, the development team was able to implement new features more quickly and with fewer iterations, reducing production time and costs.

- Scalability: As the product evolved, the design system allowed for smooth scaling, enabling new features to integrate seamlessly into the existing UI.

- User Satisfaction: The consistency and intuitiveness of the updated UI led to positive feedback from users, enhancing their overall experience on the platform.

## Results
The design system became a pivotal tool in ensuring a unified user experience across Bingocams.co.uk. Thanks to the structured collaboration, the platform’s UI consistency improved, resulting in a better product for users and a more efficient development cycle for the team. This project not only addressed the immediate needs of the UI refresh but also set a scalable foundation for future growth and design innovation.a:T888,

## Project overview 
Bingocams.co.uk is a community-driven platform where players engage in social interactions and share a passion for bingo. The objective of the project was to improve the user experience on Bingocams.co.uk by introducing personalized visual representations for players during bingo games and social interactions.
The goal was to implement a system that allows players to upload profile pictures, enhancing their presence in the gaming environment.
Also foster a more engaging and personalized experience to strengthen community connections.

## Problem
Bingocams.co.uk only displayed player names during bingo games and interactions, which resulted in a lack of personalization. This absence of visual representation diminished the social experience, limiting players' ability to connect and engage meaningfully with one another during gameplay and announcements.

## Impact

On Syndy’s platform the users are able to choose how
products are related. I had the chance to take a peek into user experience
design working together with [*Rogier Pennink*][Rogier] and [*Khalid
Laouhi*][Khalid].

My task was to create icons to give visual guidance for the users. There were
four cases: multi-pack, variety-pack, outer package and variant. First I needed
to figure out what object should be used. I made some sketches, played around
with different kind of shapes and objects. A bottle seamed to be the best
recognisable object to go with.  The next step was to finalise the visual. I
also experimented with colours, at the end I create something easy to grasp so
the user can rely on it.

Khalid created sprites out of them on codepen.io so the development team was
able to implement it more easily.

![What do users want](/works/begame-transaction-history/Transaction_00.png "List of users' needs")

## Problem statement
Bingocams’ community members experienced challenges in obtaining a clear, organized overview of their transactions. Although the transaction processes themselves were functional, a lack of clear information led to user confusion, increased customer support inquiries, and, potentially, member attrition.

## Solution
To address these challenges, I proposed a redesign of the transactions page. The updated design was intended to provide a more organized, accessible, and informative transaction experience that empowered users to track their activity confidently and independently.

## Wireframes
I created wireframes to outline key layout variations for the transaction overview page and gathered user feedback on the concepts.

![Wireframes](/works/begame-transaction-history/Transaction_000.png "Transactions oerview page wireframes")

## High-fidelity design
Once the decision was made which direction to take, I developed high-fidelity prototypes that visually emphasized transaction status, and clear labels for each transaction type.

![Before and after](/works/begame-transaction-history/Transaction_07.png "Screenshot of old UI of transactions page on the left side and a the new UI on the right side")

## Design system
To ensure consistency, I designed the transaction card components for the shared library and created detailed guidelines to support development and QA teams.

![Transaction history component](/works/begame-transaction-history/Transaction_08.png "Transaction cards in component library")

## Mockup
I created mockups for all responsive breakpoints to ensure a seamless experience across different screen sizes.

![Breakpoints](/works/begame-transaction-history/Transaction_001.png "Preview of all breakpoints and how cards were set up")

## Error handeling and empty states
I designed mockups for errors, empty states, and edge cases, collaborating closely with the development team.

![Unhappy flows](/works/begame-transaction-history/Transaction_003.png "Preview of all errors that can happen during deposit and withdrawal")

## Usability testing 
I set up usability tests on UserTesting.com to gather feedback from users and refine the high-fidelity prototypes.

## Impact
The redesigned transactions page led to significant improvements, including reduced support inquiries due to a clearer layout and transaction duration information. This project demonstrated the value of research and iterative design, as user testing helped inform design choices that addressed pain points and improved both user experience and platform efficiency.

![Feedback from user](/works/begame-transaction-history/Transaction_09.png "Being able to see the status of my transactions gives me such peace of mind, especially compared to before. Depositing and withdrawing is now a breeze!")

## But UX is never done...
This project was completed four years ago, and looking back, here are a few areas I’d love to improve today:

- Measure system usability with a usability scale.

- Test for accessibility across different devices and user groups.

- Improve micro-interactions, especially during loading states.

- Conduct more frequent usability testing throughout the product lifecycle.

- Enhance assisted onboarding to help all users quickly understand the updated transaction processes.

## My role
I collaborated with the front-end development team and another product designer to spearhead the creation and ongoing maintenance of a comprehensive design system. 

- Designing and documenting reusable components
- Ensuring design consistency 
- Facilitating a smooth handoff between design and development

## Tools
Sketch, Zeplin, BootstrapVue, Material Icons, Confluence, Jira

## Duration
The foundational work on the design system took approximately two months. I then continued to maintain and refine the system over the following two years, adapting it to new product requirements and feedback.

## Project overview
To streamline the collaboration between product and development teams and create a cohesive visual language across the Bingocams platform, I co-led the creation of a robust design system. Built on Bootstrap, the system became the UI backbone, providing a library of reusable components, design guidelines, and visual standards that enhanced consistency across the platform. By establishing a scalable design framework, we were able to expedite feature development and improve cross-functional communication, ensuring alignment on visual and functional details from the outset.

## Problem
Bingocams.co.uk, a community-focused bingo platform, was undergoing a UI refresh to improve the user experience. However, the lack of a structured component library created inefficiencies in the design and development process, often resulting in an inconsistent user experience and requiring repetitive work for common UI elements. This inconsistency affected both the platform’s usability and the speed of implementation.

## Process
- Research & Analysis: Conducted an audit of existing UI elements to identify inconsistencies and redundancies across the platform.

- Design System Structure: Created a component library using BootstrapVue as a foundation, prioritizing components commonly used across Bingocams.co.uk. Worked with stakeholders to define design guidelines, ensuring they were aligned with the brand’s visual identity and adaptable to various platform requirements.

- Documentation: Documented each component’s usage, interaction states, and styling specifications in Zeplin, making it easier for developers to integrate components accurately.

- Iterative Testing & Feedback: Regularly tested components in the platform environment, gathered feedback from both designers and developers, and made adjustments as needed. This collaborative process helped us refine and expand the design system over time.

## Impact
The introduction of the design system had a notable impact on both the product and team workflows:

- Consistency and Cohesion: The platform's visual consistency improved significantly, providing users with a seamless and intuitive interface that aligned with Bingocams’ brand identity.

- Efficiency and Productivity: With a shared library of components and design guidelines, the development team was able to implement new features more quickly and with fewer iterations, reducing production time and costs.

- Scalability: As the product evolved, the design system allowed for smooth scaling, enabling new features to integrate seamlessly into the existing UI.

- User Satisfaction: The consistency and intuitiveness of the updated UI led to positive feedback from users, enhancing their overall experience on the platform.

## Results
The design system became a pivotal tool in ensuring a unified user experience across Bingocams.co.uk. Thanks to the structured collaboration, the platform’s UI consistency improved, resulting in a better product for users and a more efficient development cycle for the team. This project not only addressed the immediate needs of the UI refresh but also set a scalable foundation for future growth and design innovation.a:T12ff,

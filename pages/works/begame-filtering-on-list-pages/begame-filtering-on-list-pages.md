To help users find easier what they are looking for on overview/list pages, filters were introduced to some of the pages on this bingo site.
Users could filter on date, status, categories etc.
The complexity and the structure of the site wouldn’t allow to have the filters in the left sidebar, so a simple dropdown button on desktop and on mobile was the solution for the MVP.

Another challenge: Most of the pages differ in the title area, some had tabs, some contained the user’s balance and other information, so finding a place for the filter button was straightforward either. On mobile it got even more complicated due to the size of the screen. The only unified solution could have been to have the filter button fixed to the left, right below the page title. For the selected filters, filter chips were introduced to make the filter management smoother.

After sketching all this out, aligned with the PO, dev and the lead designer, I created the filter related symbols in the shared Sketch library. I also created a style guide page to make the handover to the front-end team easier. And delivered the final pages in Zeplin.

The result was a nicely functioning feature. Maybe not the perfect solution, but a good start that can be fine tuned in the near future.

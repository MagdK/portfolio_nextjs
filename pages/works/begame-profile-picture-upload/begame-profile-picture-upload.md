After I gathered enough knowledge from the product owner and marekting manager about bingo players, I introduced Anita and Susanne - our bingo personas - to our team to have a better understanding what our users' needs, goals and pain points are. These personas helped me realise that the whole bingo experience has to be a lot more personalised. For the users to be able to show their faces by uploading a profile picture is only a small step, but gives a personal touch to it all when they are in the bingo room chat, or when they make it to the leaderboard.

I brought up the topic with stakeholders and pushed for this small feature for the sake of our users.

I sketched out the user flow and built a simple prototype in InVision to explain the flow to PO and dev.
It is pretty straightforward: The user clicks on the account menu, goes to the account detail page and selects the profile picture accordion in order to upload their photo. From that point, the process is pretty self explenatory. They can take a selfie with their camera or just upload an already existing photo from their device. The image can be repositioned and zoomed in or out if needed.

The image upload flow is easy to use on desktop and mobile too. The profile picture will be visible in chat rooms, on the leaderboard, on their personal hub and of in the top navigation and account menu.

I did a thorough research on other platforms to get a good idea how the tool should function, what should be included, what is an overkill. Aligned with front-end if it will be built from scratch or not, to know how much free hand do I get during the design process. The UI was created in Sketch, final pages were exported to Zeplin, and I was checking on with front-end during the implementation to make sure all is well.

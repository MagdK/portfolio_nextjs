    "description": "The following designs are part of an online bingo project. A tiny part and probably not the most important, but interesting nevertheless.

    The purpose of these pages is to give a clear overview of all user transactions and help them not to lose track of their spendings.
    
    When users are actively engaging with the website, there are different transactions that happen during their experience. This page is supposed to help them keep track all of it: deposits, withdrawals and every game play.
    
    During the design process I gathered information from stakeholders to clarify what each and every card should contain, what status the transactions have, if they have any. I also considered fluid design and how the layout would change on different devices. I created the fluid symbol in the shared Sketch symbol library, made a style guide page to make the handover to the front-end team easier and also provided the final UI in Zeplin for all the breakpoints.
    
    After a couple of iterations the result was a clean and easily scannable transactions page."

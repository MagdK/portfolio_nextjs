Desszert.Neked hired the company I worked for in 2015 to design and build a
website for their newly started pastry shop. In collaboration with Anita Forray,
the head of marketing I created a website in a couple of weeks. Tamas Drab, full
stack developer gave us feedbacks about options and possibilities regarding the
gallery and online payment methods.

The challenge was to match the design with their shop’s look and feel. It was a
big project, with many pages and different kind of assets. A home page with a
big slider and a form to sign up form, a gallery page to showcase all their
desserts, a page for the actual courses, a form to sign up to the chosen course,
about page and a contact page.

The three main colours were dark grey, light purple and baby blue, the colour of
their logo they provided for us. I used a light zig-zag pattern in the
background to bring back the pattern of the shop’s wall and I also used the
logo’s dots as a main element in the design.

The result is an easy to use website, where you can brows through all the sweets
they can offer and apply easily to the next course to learn how to make them. I
really enjoyed working on this project, looking at all those beautiful pictures
all day long, just made me hungry. And the taste! Try it if you are close by the
place.

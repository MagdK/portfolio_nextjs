    "description": "This brilliant feature allows users to access their showrooms anywhere anytime. It also gives the brand the chance to tell their story better by creating a fully branded experience using inspirational content like videos, look books, images and allowing them to link their styles to it.
    Buyers can access the brand content, scan through the upcoming collections and place orders without the need of leaving their office/store.
    
    Working closely with brand users, sales, development team and the product owner, first we needed to get to a common understanding regarding the users and market's problems: visiting showrooms was costly and time consuming. An other pain point: if a meeting happens outside of the physical showroom, sales reps need to carry a huge amount of samples to the meeting.
    
    After defining the general problem, my roles with the design team was to create prototypes and conduct user researches to get feedback about our understanding and assumptions. Based on the findings, we iterated on the user flow, made sure that the experience is smooth for brand and retailer users too and created an omni-channel experience."

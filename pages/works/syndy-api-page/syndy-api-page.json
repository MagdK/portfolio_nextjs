    "description": "At Syndy I was created a marketing page for Syndy's API. [Algirdas
        Desceras][Algis] created the wireframe and I also got some help from the dev
        guys [Rogier Pennink][Rogier] and [Boris Samoyenko][Boris] during the designing
        process.
        
        The task was to make sure that the visitor understands what a big advantage is
        to use Syndy via API. The main emphasis is still on the copy, but the icons and
        other visual elements are there to help to understand it better. As a result we
        ended up with an easy to digest page.

At Syndy I was created a marketing page for Syndy's API. [Algirdas
Desceras][Algis] created the wireframe and I also got some help from the dev
guys [Rogier Pennink][Rogier] and [Boris Samoyenko][Boris] during the designing
process.

The task was to make sure that the visitor understands what a big advantage is
to use Syndy via API. The main emphasis is still on the copy, but the icons and
other visual elements are there to help to understand it better. As a result we
ended up with an easy to digest page.

    platform just into one page.
    
    I worked on this site with [Algirdas Desceras][Algis], former head of marketing
    at Syndy.  He created the wireframe and gave me the copy to work with. I created
    icons to illustrate what is Syndy used for.
    
    Also made a nice looking 4 steps guide to show how the export works, and created
    sreenshots to let the visitors have a closer look of what else Syndy can offer
    to them. The final result turned out to be a nice summary of the platform,
    simple, clean and easy to understand for those also who are not in this
    business.

Working at Syndy, a company with a unique solution to distribute and optimise
product content, I had the chance to recreate their retailer page on the corporate website in
collaboration with the marketing lead, [**Algirdas Desceras**][Algis]. My role was to
transform the copy into a nice looking, eye-catching page. The colour choices are
based on the guides created for Syndyâ€™s platform.
As a result, we ended up with a clean and simple page that explains
all the benefits the company has for retailers.

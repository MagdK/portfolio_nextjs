## Project overview
Customer feedback revealed unintuitive transaction processes, leading to frequent support inquiries. This project streamlined deposits and withdrawals, reduced requests, and improved satisfaction by providing clear, accessible flows and an intuitive overview to help users track and manage transactions.

## Problem discovery research
To uncover problems in the current experience, I conducted usability tests with 5 new and 5 returning users via UserTesting.com. Combined with insights from customer success, the research revealed users' frustrations with unclear transaction statuses, cumbersome navigation, and the inability to cancel transactions, all of which contributed to their dissatisfaction.

## Key findings
What do users want:

## Problem statement
Bingocams’ community members experienced challenges in obtaining a clear, organized overview of their transactions. Although the transaction processes themselves were functional, a lack of clear information led to user confusion, increased customer support inquiries, and, potentially, member attrition.

## Solution
To address these challenges, I proposed a redesign of the transactions page. The updated design was intended to provide a more organized, accessible, and informative transaction experience that empowered users to track their activity confidently and independently.

- Wireframes: I created low-fidelity wireframes to outline key layout changes, ensuring the design prioritized clarity and usability.

- High-fidelity designs: Once approved, I developed high-fidelity prototypes that visually emphasized transaction status, estimated processing times, and clear labels for each transaction type.

- Testing: I conducted usability tests with five users on UserTesting.com to validate and refine the high-fidelity prototypes.

- Design system integration: To ensure consistency, I created components for the design system and detailed guidelines to support development and QA teams.

## Impact
The redesigned transactions page led to significant improvements, including reduced support inquiries due to a clearer layout and transaction duration information. This project demonstrated the value of research and iterative design, as user testing helped inform design choices that addressed pain points and improved both user experience and platform efficiency.


## But UX is never done...
This project was completed four years ago, and looking back, here are a few areas I’d love to improve today:

- Measure system usability with a usability scale.

- Test for accessibility across different devices and user groups.

- Improve micro-interactions, especially during loading states.

- Conduct more frequent usability testing throughout the product lifecycle.

- Enhance assisted onboarding to help all users quickly understand the updated transaction processes.

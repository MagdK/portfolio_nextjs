## Problem statement
Fashion wholesalers face challenges adapting to digital-first environments, often relying on outdated, in-person sales methods that depend on spreadsheets and paper. These traditional approaches make it difficult for brands to efficiently communicate their unique stories and align with modern business practices. This lack of a digital solution restricts operational efficiency and limits the reach of brand narratives in an increasingly online marketplace.

"How might we help brands to tell their stories?"

"How might we help retailers to find the perfect brands for their stores?"

## Goal
Our goal is to build a digital showroom experience that empowers brands to showcase their unique stories online. This will streamline processes, reduce costs, and facilitate a smooth transition to modern, digital-first operations, aligning fashion wholesalers with contemporary industry practices.

## User research
- Workshop with brand owners - conducted by PO and lead UX/UIer


- Gather insights from workshop, understand the needs and pain points of brands.
  1.  Insight #1: Brands need to be able to tell their stories in order to connect with the right retailers and to be able to make sales.
  2.  Insight #2: Collections in the digital showroom need to be customisable based on the brand's needs.
  3.   Insight #3: Brands can have multiple collection at the same time.

- Come up with a solution to help brands have an online presence, provide them tools that allows them to tell their stories in order to make online trading smoother.

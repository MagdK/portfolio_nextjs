In this React project I used two API calls: one to access some images and a second call to gather data (name and email) from a remote json file. On pageload all the character cards load. The search box allows me to search by name in the list. I used media queries to make the site responsive and created the project with class components and in a separate branch with functional components for the sake of practice.

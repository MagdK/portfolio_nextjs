My role was to create templates that are consistent, clean and minimalistic,
just like emails should be, with the look and feel of Syndy’s platform. I was
working together with the company’s CTO [*Rogier Pennink*][Rogier] and [*Khalid
Laouhi*][Khalid], lead designer at Syndy. The main email types were the
following: welcome emails, invite emails and platform related notifications. The
colour choices are based on the platform guides created by Khalid. It was
important to keep the main elements consistent in every case. For a better
understanding I made a short guideline for the developers. The final results are
clear and minimalistic.

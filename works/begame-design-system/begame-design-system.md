Project overview
To be able to have a consistent visual language and smoother collaboration between design and development, we need to create and maintine a design system. 

Problem
Bingocams.co.uk gets a UI refresh. Not relying on a consistent and well structured component library makes the design and implementation process hard and give an inconsistent experience to the users. 

Objectives
- Find an existing library that can be used with Vue to speed up the redesigning process. 

Goal
How might we create a user interface that gives the users a consistent and clear experience?

Needs
- Ability to .
- Ability to differentiate between transaction occurances by providing a transaction ID. 
- Ability to differentiate and get informed about transaction statuses. 
- Ability to access transaction methods. 
- Ability to access transaction times. 

Wants
- Track transactions without needing to reach out to customer support.
- Clear overview of all transactions.

At Begame I helped develop a design system that would significantly speed up the design process and make the Bingocams platform more consistent and better to use. In collaboration with the lead UXer, Karen Namgung we were responsible for leading the design in this project and researching how to best build such a system, made sure that our library is accessible, future-focused and human-centred. The result is that there is now a solid framework which can be further improved as the platform matures.

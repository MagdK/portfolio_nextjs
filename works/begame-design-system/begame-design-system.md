At Begame I helped develop a design system that would significantly speed up the design process and make the Bingocams platform more consistent and better to use. In collaboration with the lead UXer, Karen Namgung we were responsible for leading the design in this project and researching how to best build such a system, made sure that our library is accessible, future-focused and human-centred. The result is that there is now a solid framework which can be further improved as the platform matures.

## Project overview
To streamline collaboration between design and development teams and ensure a cohesive visual language across the platform, I led the creation and ongoing maintenance of a robust design system. Built on Bootstrap, this system not only enhanced consistency in design but also allowed for faster implementation of features and smoother communication between teams. It became the backbone of our UI development, providing reusable components and design guidelines that scaled efficiently as the product evolved.

## Problem
Bingocams.co.uk gets a UI refresh. Not relying on a consistent and well structured component library makes the design and implementation process hard and gives an inconsistent experience to the users. 

## Objectives
Find a library that can be used with Vue to speed up the redesig and development process. 

## Goal
How might we create a user interface that gives the users a consistent and clear experience?

## Needs
- Accessibile.
- Scalable.  

## Wants
Plug and play components instead of custom components whenever possible.

At Begame I helped develop a design system that significantly sped up the design process and made the Bingocams platform more consistent. In collaboration with the lead UXer, Karen Namgung we were responsible for leading the design in this project and researching how to best build such a system, made sure that our library is accessible, future-focused and human-centred. The result is that there is now a solid framework which can be further improved as the platform matures.

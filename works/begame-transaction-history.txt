<h2>Impact</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enhanced user satisfaction with improved usability and intuitive design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decreased support inquiries by streamlining workflows and reducing friction points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accelerated deposit and withdrawal processes, making transactions smoother and more efficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved user engagement by creating a more seamless and enjoyable experience.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Project overview</h2>
<p>Users found the transaction processes confusing, leading to frequent support requests.
This project simplified deposits and withdrawals, introduced intuitive transaction flows, and provided a clear overview, reducing support needs and enhancing user satisfaction.</p>
<h2>Problem statement</h2>
<p>Bingocams’ community members experienced challenges in obtaining a clear, organized overview of their transactions. Although the transaction processes themselves were functional, a lack of clear information led to user confusion, increased customer support inquiries, and, potentially, member attrition.</p>
<h2>Problem discovery research</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Feedback analysis: Reviewed insights from the customer success team to understand recurring user concerns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User testing: Conducted usability tests with 5 new and 5 returning users via UserTesting.com, focusing on depositing, withdrawing, and navigation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Key findings: Identified frustrations with unclear transaction statuses, cumbersome navigation, and the inability to cancel transactions, which drove dissatisfaction.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key findings</h2>
<p>What do users want:</p>
<p><img src="/works/begame-transaction-history/Transaction_03.png" alt="What do users want" title="List of users&#x27; needs"></p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>To address these challenges, I proposed a redesign of the transactions page. The updated design was intended to provide a more organized, accessible, and informative transaction experience that empowered users to track their activity confidently and independently.</p>
<h2>Wireframes</h2>
<p>I created wireframes to outline key layout variations for the transaction overview page and gathered user feedback on the concepts.</p>
<p><img src="/works/begame-transaction-history/Transaction_04.png" alt="Wiewframe" title="Concepts of new transaction"></p>
<h2>High-fidelity design</h2>
<p>Once the decision was made which direction to take, I developed high-fidelity prototypes that visually emphasized transaction status, and clear labels for each transaction type.</p>
<h2>Design system</h2>
<p>To ensure consistency, I designed the transaction card components for the shared library and created detailed guidelines to support development and QA teams.</p>
<p><img src="/works/begame-transaction-history/Transaction_05.png" alt="Transaction history component" title="Transaction cards in component library"></p>
<h2>Mockup</h2>
<p>I created mockups for all responsive breakpoints to ensure a seamless experience across different screen sizes.</p>
<p><img src="/works/begame-transaction-history/Transaction_06.png" alt="Breakpoints" title="Preview of all breakpoints and how cards were set up"></p>
<h2>Error handeling and empty states</h2>
<p>I designed mockups for errors, empty states, and edge cases, collaborating closely with the development team.</p>
<p><img src="/works/begame-transaction-history/Transaction_07.png" alt="Unhappy flows" title="Preview of all errors that can happen during deposit and withdrawal"></p>
<h2>Usability testing</h2>
<p>I set up usability tests on UserTesting.com to gather feedback from users and refine the high-fidelity prototypes.</p>
<p><img src="/works/begame-transaction-history/Transaction_08.png" alt="Feedback from user" title="Being able to see the status of my transactions gives me such peace of mind, especially compared to before. Depositing and withdrawing is now a breeze!"></p>
<h2>But UX is never done...</h2>
<p>This project was completed four years ago, and looking back, here are a few areas I’d love to improve today:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Measure system usability with a usability scale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test for accessibility across different devices and user groups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve micro-interactions, especially during loading states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conduct more frequent usability testing throughout the product lifecycle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhance assisted onboarding to help all users quickly understand the updated transaction processes.</p>
</li>

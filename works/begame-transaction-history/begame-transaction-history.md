## Project overview
Users found the transaction processes confusing, leading to frequent support requests. 
This project simplified deposits and withdrawals, introduced intuitive transaction flows, and provided a clear overview, reducing support needs and enhancing user satisfaction.

## Problem discovery research
- Feedback Analysis: Reviewed insights from the customer success team to understand recurring user concerns.

- User Testing: Conducted usability tests with 5 new and 5 returning users via UserTesting.com, focusing on depositing, withdrawing, and navigation.

- Key Findings: Identified frustrations with unclear transaction statuses, cumbersome navigation, and the inability to cancel transactions, which drove dissatisfaction.

## Key findings
What do users want:

## Problem statement
Bingocams’ community members experienced challenges in obtaining a clear, organized overview of their transactions. Although the transaction processes themselves were functional, a lack of clear information led to user confusion, increased customer support inquiries, and, potentially, member attrition.

## Solution
To address these challenges, I proposed a redesign of the transactions page. The updated design was intended to provide a more organized, accessible, and informative transaction experience that empowered users to track their activity confidently and independently.

## Wireframes
I created wireframes to outline key layout variations for the transaction overview page and gathered user feedback on the concepts.

## High-fidelity design
Once the decision was made which direction to take, I developed high-fidelity prototypes that visually emphasized transaction status, and clear labels for each transaction type.

## Design system
To ensure consistency, I created the transaction cards components for the design system and detailed guidelines to support development and QA teams.

## Mockup
I created the final mockups for every breakpoint.

## Error handeling and empty states
I made sure to create mockups for each error. For this I worked closely with the development team. Also created mockups for the empty states and other edge cases.

## Usability testing 
I set up usability tests on UserTesting.com to gather feedback from users and refine the high-fidelity prototypes.

## Impact
The redesigned transactions page led to significant improvements, including reduced support inquiries due to a clearer layout and transaction duration information. This project demonstrated the value of research and iterative design, as user testing helped inform design choices that addressed pain points and improved both user experience and platform efficiency.


## But UX is never done...
This project was completed four years ago, and looking back, here are a few areas I’d love to improve today:

- Measure system usability with a usability scale.

- Test for accessibility across different devices and user groups.

- Improve micro-interactions, especially during loading states.

- Conduct more frequent usability testing throughout the product lifecycle.

- Enhance assisted onboarding to help all users quickly understand the updated transaction processes.

## My role
UX research | UI design | UX design | Cross-functionally collaboration

## Duration
2 months

## Project overview
The goal was to enhance the deposit and withdrawal experience for users of an online gaming app by streamlining transaction management, reducing overspending, minimizing user churn, and boosting satisfaction.

## Research
I conducted user research through unmoderated tests on usertesting.com, interviewing five new users and five long-term users via customer support to identify pain points in transaction processes.

## Findings
While users found the deposit and withdrawal processes straightforward, they often lacked clarity about transaction durations, leading to increased inquiries to customer support.

## Proposed Solution
In response, I proposed a redesign of the transactions page. After approval of the wireframes, I developed high-fidelity designs tested by five users on usertesting.com. I also created components for our design system and established guidelines for smooth implementation by the development and QA teams.

## Problem
Bingocams community members experience difficulty in obtaining a clear and organized overview of their transactions, including deposits, withdrawals, and gameplay activities. Despite smooth transaction processes, this lack of clarity leads to increased complaints and inquiries to customer support, which may ultimately result in member attrition.

## Impact
The redesign of the transactions page significantly enhanced user experience by providing a clearer and more organized overview of deposit and withdrawal activities. This improvement led to several key outcomes:

- Reduced Support Inquiries: By clarifying transaction durations and improving the overall layout, users had fewer questions, resulting in decreased inquiries to customer support.

- Increased User Satisfaction: A more intuitive transaction process enhanced user confidence and satisfaction, fostering a more positive relationship with the platform.

- Lower User Churn: With improved clarity and a seamless experience, users were less likely to disengage, contributing to a reduction in user churn rates.

- Enhanced Engagement: A streamlined transaction management process encouraged users to engage more frequently with the app, potentially increasing overall participation in games and activities.

- Data-Driven Insights: The ongoing feedback and testing provided valuable data for future enhancements, ensuring that the platform continued to evolve in line with user needs.

Overall, this project aimed to create a more satisfying and efficient user experience, ultimately supporting the long-term success and growth of the Bingocams community.

## Problem statement
Fashion wholesalers, unlike those in other sectors, did not embrace the digital era; instead, trade took place in person, mostly via spreadsheets and paper. This approach is inefficient in terms of time and cost. The main challenge for brands transitioning to an online trading tool was the inability to effectively tell their brand's story.

"How might we help brands to tell their stories?"

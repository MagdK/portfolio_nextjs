In this JavaScript project I used one of NASAâ€™s free API called [*Astronomical Picture of the Day*][Astronomical Picture of the Day] (APOD).  
On page load the image or video of the day loads with the title, date and description of that media. With a date picker you can select any other day in the past and make a new API call that will update the page accordingly. With the help of next and previous buttons you are able to go one day forward or backward. The random button will pick you a date between June 16 1995 (since this API is running) and today. 

Check out the app on Heroku to see the end result (heads-up: it might take a bit of time to load) or go to the Github repository.

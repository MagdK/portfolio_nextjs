In this React project I used two API calls: one to access some images from [*DiceBear avatar library*][DiceBear avatar library] and a second call to gather [*some random data*][some random data] (name and email) from a remote json file.  
On page load all the contact cards load. The search box allows me to search by name in the list.  
I used media queries to make the site responsive and created the project with class components and in a separate branch with functional components for the sake of practice.  

Check out the app on Heroku to see the end result (heads-up: it might take a bit of time to load) or go to the Github repository.

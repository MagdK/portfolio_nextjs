The challenge was to squeeze in all the great things you can do with Syndy’s
platform just into one page.

I worked on this site with [*Algirdas Desceras*][Algis], the head of marketing
at Syndy.  He created the wireframe and gave me the copy to work with. I created
icons to illustrate what is Syndy used for.

Also made a nice looking 4 steps guide to show how the export works, and created
sreenshots to let the visitors have a closer look of what else Syndy can offer
to them. The final result turned out to be a nice summary of the platform,
simple, clean and easy to understand for those also who are not in this
business.

On Syndyâ€™s platform the users are able to choose how
products are related. I had the chance to take a peek into user experience
design working together with [*Rogier Pennink*][Rogier] and [*Khalid
Laouhi*][Khalid].

My task was to create icons to give visual guidance for the users. There were
four cases: multi-pack, variety-pack, outer package and variant. First I needed
to figure out what object should be used. I made some sketches, played around
with different kind of shapes and objects. A bottle seamed to be the best
recognisable object to go with.  The next step was to finalise the visual. I
also experimented with colours, at the end I create something easy to grasp so
the user can rely on it.

Khalid created sprites out of them on codepen.io so the development team was
able to implement it more easily.
